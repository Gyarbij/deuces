# Deuces
Your Digital Death Assistant


## What it does

It polls for signs-of-life and if there are none and a user determined period elapses, sends a final message to platforms of the users choosing (a final middle finger if you will) then terminates the respectives accounts.

## To-Do
* Wipe Sensitive files
* Transfer ownership of accounts etc.
* Set self-hosted projects to maintaince mode or a graceful shutdown because your family is already dealing with your death, they don't need to be bothered about why plex can't play those videos you took while alive.
* rm * -rf
